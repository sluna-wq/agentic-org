*Update protocol: CTO-Agent appends a row after every autonomous cycle (per PB-018). "Actions Taken" summarizes what was attempted. "Outcome" notes successes AND failures. Keep entries glanceable — CEO should understand each row in 5 seconds.*
| 3 (latest) | 2026-02-15T13:13:58Z | ~45min | BL-017: Pilot plan & design partner strategy | Wrote comprehensive 13-section pilot plan (500+ lines, `product/pilot-plan.md`): product context, goals (primary/secondary/NOT), success metrics (must-have + red flags), partner selection (Tier 1-3 criteria + disqualifiers), 4-week timeline (Prep → Week 1-3 execution → Week 4 synthesis), outreach channels (network + community, expected yield), onboarding flow (5-step journey), feedback framework (structured questions + templates), success scenarios (best→failure), synthesis deliverables (pilot-synthesis.md structure), open questions for CEO, risk assessment (technical/market/execution). Added LRN-015. Updated STATE/BACKLOG/BRIEFING/CYCLE-LOG. | ✓ Complete — Pilot plan ready for CEO review. BL-019 (Week 0 prep) queued. | Yes (CEO review) |
| 2 | 2026-02-15T08:50:47Z | ~45min | BL-016: Test Generator agent v0 | Implemented full Test Generator capability: TestCoverageAnalyzer (pattern-based gap detection with priority scoring), SchemaYamlGenerator (PR-ready YAML with placeholders for complex tests), updated CLI with analyze + generate-tests commands (rich output with tables), 35+ unit tests (coverage analyzer + YAML generator). Pattern-based approach validated (LRN-014). Updated all org artifacts. | ✓ Complete — First autonomous agent capability shipped! Ready for pilot testing. BL-017 (pilot plan) next. | No |

Analyzed what they're NOT building (operational agents, autonomous remediation, cross-stack, aggressive Core monetization). Wrote comprehensive defensibility analysis (`research/defensibility-analysis.md`, 8 sections, 9K+ words): overlap analysis (test generation = moderate, different use cases), strategic constraints (partnership lock-in, Core community tension, dev>ops DNA, enterprise governance), moat framework (operational expertise, cross-stack, Core focus, safety/trust), threat scenarios with mitigation, positioning strategy ("operational layer dbt is missing"), recommendations. DEC-010 logged. Updated STATE/BACKLOG/BRIEFING/LEARNINGS/DECISIONS. | ✓ Complete — dbt Guardian defensibility validated. Strategic constraints on dbt Labs create permanent opening. Window open NOW (6-12mo). Path: win Core users → autonomous capabilities → cross-stack. LRN-016 captured. | No |
| 5 | 2026-02-15T20:43:55Z | ~15min | BL-005: Developer tooling & environment setup | Created complete developer tooling infrastructure in `products/dbt-guardian/`: (1) GitHub Actions workflows (.github/workflows/test.yml with Python 3.11/3.12 matrix + coverage, lint.yml with ruff/black/isort/mypy/pip-audit, release.yml with PyPI trusted publishing), (2) Makefile with 15+ targets (test, lint, format, type-check, security, audit, clean, run), (3) .pre-commit-config.yaml (5 hooks), (4) VS Code config (.vscode/settings.json, extensions.json, launch.json), (5) .editorconfig for cross-editor consistency, (6) .python-version for pyenv, (7) CONTRIBUTING.md (6-section dev guide with examples).

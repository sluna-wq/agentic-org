# /inbox — CEO Inbox Quick View

Read `CEO.md` and display the **Your Queue** section.

## Rules
- Show queue items cleanly, as-is
- NO analysis, NO context loading, NO org work
- Do not read STATE.md, BACKLOG.md, or any other files
- If the queue is empty, say: "Queue empty. Nothing pending."
- Keep it fast and cheap — this is a glance, not a briefing

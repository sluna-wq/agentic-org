# /inbox — CEO Inbox Quick View

Read `.cto-private/CEO-INBOX.md` and display the **Pending** section.

## Rules
- Show pending items cleanly, as-is
- NO analysis, NO context loading, NO org work
- Do not read STATE.md, BACKLOG.md, or any other files
- If there are no pending items, say: "Inbox empty. Nothing pending."
- Keep it fast and cheap — this is a glance, not a briefing

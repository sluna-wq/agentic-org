## Phase
`PLANNING` — Building AI agent expertise. Backlog seeded, daemon ready to execute.

Phases: `BOOTSTRAP` → `PLANNING` → `BUILDING` → `SHIPPING` → `OPERATING`

## Current Cycle
- **Cycle #**: 0 (no autonomous cycles run yet)
- **Started**: —
- **Mode**: Interactive (CEO session)
- **Focus**: CEO direction received — seeding backlog and prepping for autonomous research

## Current Focus
Pre-product CTO work: AI agent expertise, technical standards, market research, product vision drafting. 8 backlog items queued (BL-001 through BL-008). GitHub repo set up for continuous push. Daemon ready.

## Active Work
| ID | Description | Owner | Phase | Last Activity | ETA | Blocker? |
|----|-------------|-------|-------|---------------|-----|----------|
| BL-001 | AI agent landscape research | CTO-Agent | Claimed | 2026-02-11 | Next daemon cycle | No |
| BL-002 | Claude Code & Agent SDK deep dive | CTO-Agent | Claimed | 2026-02-11 | Next daemon cycle | No |
| BL-004 | Technical standards & conventions | CTO-Agent | Claimed | 2026-02-11 | After BL-001/002 | No |

## Blockers
None.

## Key Context
- GitHub repo live — continuous push enabled, daemon auto-pushes after each cycle
- CTO Autonomous Zone expanded — full repo authority with do-no-harm principle (DEC-005)
- 8 backlog items: research (BL-001, 002), standards (BL-004, 005), market/product (BL-006, 007), talent (BL-003), stress test (BL-008)
- DIR-001 + DIR-002 active
- CTO-Agent operating solo, no specialists

## Recent Decisions
- DEC-001: Bootstrap org with self-referential knowledge architecture (2026-02-11)
- DEC-002: Build two explicit interfaces — CEO↔Org and Org↔Product (2026-02-11)
- DEC-003: Redesign for autonomy, privacy, AI-native operation (2026-02-11)
- DEC-004: Prioritize AI agent expertise building as pre-product foundation (2026-02-11)
- DEC-005: Expand CTO autonomy, GitHub CI, proactive CTO backlog (2026-02-11)

## Upcoming
- Daemon executes BL-001 and BL-002 (AI agent research) — first cycle
- BL-004: Technical standards & conventions
- BL-006: Market landscape research
- BL-007: Product vision drafting (CEO review)
- First weekly sync (`/sync`)

## Health
| Dimension | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Delivery | N/A | No product work started |
| Quality | N/A | No product work started |
| Team | Minimal | CTO-Agent only, no specialists |
| Knowledge | Strong | Full artifact suite, skills, daemon, three interfaces |

> **This is the single source of truth for "where are we right now."**
> Any agent starting a session reads this first. Any agent completing work updates this.

## Phase
`BOOTSTRAP` — Org structure is being established. No product work yet.

Phases: `BOOTSTRAP` → `PLANNING` → `BUILDING` → `SHIPPING` → `OPERATING`

## Current Focus
Establishing foundational org artifacts and governance structure.

## Active Work
| ID | Description | Owner | Status | Started |
|----|-------------|-------|--------|---------|
| BOOT-001 | Org bootstrap — create all foundational artifacts | CTO-Agent | In Progress | 2026-02-11 |

## Blockers
None.

## Key Context
- No product direction set yet — awaiting CEO strategic input after bootstrap
- No specialist agents hired yet — CTO-Agent operating solo
- No codebase exists yet — repo contains only org artifacts

## Recent Decisions
- DEC-001: Bootstrap org with self-referential knowledge architecture (2026-02-11)

## Upcoming
- CEO to set product direction and initial priorities
- CTO-Agent to propose initial roadmap and agent staffing plan
- First weekly planning cycle

## Health
| Dimension | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Delivery | N/A | No product work started |
| Quality | N/A | No product work started |
| Team | Minimal | CTO-Agent only, no specialists |
| Knowledge | Bootstrapping | Foundational docs being written |

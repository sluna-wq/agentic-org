## Phase
`PLANNING` — Org infrastructure complete. Awaiting CEO product direction.

Phases: `BOOTSTRAP` → `PLANNING` → `BUILDING` → `SHIPPING` → `OPERATING`

## Current Focus
All org infrastructure built — including CEO↔Org and Org↔Product interfaces. Ready for CEO to set product direction.

## Active Work
| ID | Description | Owner | Status | Started |
|----|-------------|-------|--------|---------|
| — | *No active work — awaiting CEO direction* | — | — | — |

## Blockers
None.

## Key Context
- Org has 12 artifacts: 9 foundational + DIRECTIVES.md, BRIEFING.md, WORKBENCH.md
- CEO↔Org interface: DIRECTIVES.md (CEO→Org), BRIEFING.md + STATE.md (Org→CEO)
- Org↔Product interface: WORKBENCH.md defines execution protocol, product/ dir created on product kickoff
- 13 playbooks (PB-001 through PB-013) cover all operational patterns
- DIR-001 active: complete org infrastructure before product work
- No product direction set yet — awaiting CEO strategic input
- CTO-Agent operating solo, no specialists

## Recent Decisions
- DEC-001: Bootstrap org with self-referential knowledge architecture (2026-02-11)
- DEC-002: Build two explicit interfaces — CEO↔Org and Org↔Product (2026-02-11)

## Upcoming
- CEO to set product direction and initial priorities
- CTO-Agent to propose initial roadmap and agent staffing plan
- First weekly planning cycle

## Health
| Dimension | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Delivery | N/A | No product work started |
| Quality | N/A | No product work started |
| Team | Minimal | CTO-Agent only, no specialists |
| Knowledge | Strong | 12 artifacts, 13 playbooks, all cross-referenced |

## Phase
`PLANNING` — CEO shared product direction. Foundational research underway.

Phases: `BOOTSTRAP` → `PLANNING` → `BUILDING` → `SHIPPING` → `OPERATING`

## Current Cycle
- **Cycle #**: 1 (first autonomous daemon cycle)
- **Started**: 2026-02-12T12:33:18Z
- **Mode**: Autonomous (daemon-triggered)
- **Focus**: Foundational AI agent research (BL-001 completed)

## Current Focus
Foundational research phase per DIR-002. Product exploration complete (BL-009–012, 4 docs in `research/` awaiting CEO review). Now building AI agent expertise foundation. BL-001 (AI agent landscape) complete. BL-002 (Claude Code deep dive) next.

## Active Work
| ID | Description | Owner | Phase | Last Activity | ETA | Blocker? |
|----|-------------|-------|-------|---------------|-----|----------|
| BL-002 | Claude Code & Agent SDK deep dive | CTO-Agent | Queued | 2026-02-12 | Next cycle | No |

## Blockers
None.

## Key Context
- **CEO-CTO alignment applied (DEC-007)**: Conversation mode vs execution mode, separate product repos, /inbox skill, enhanced activity logs, cloud deployment path documented
- **CEO product direction received**: Autonomous agents for data stack management (DEC-006)
- Product repos model: products live in separate git repos (see .product-repos.md), not subdirectories
- GitHub repo live — continuous push enabled
- CTO Autonomous Zone expanded — full repo authority with do-no-harm principle (DEC-005)
- 13 backlog items (BL-013 added: cloud deployment)
- DIR-001 + DIR-002 active
- CTO-Agent operating solo, no specialists
- **Ongoing discussions** (not yet codified): leadership principles, credit efficiency / org measurement

## Recent Decisions
- DEC-007: CEO-CTO alignment — conversation mode, separate repos, operational evolution (2026-02-12)
- DEC-006: CEO product direction — autonomous agents for data stack excellence (2026-02-11)
- DEC-005: Expand CTO autonomy, GitHub CI, proactive CTO backlog (2026-02-11)
- DEC-004: Prioritize AI agent expertise building as pre-product foundation (2026-02-11)

## Upcoming
- **CEO review of product concepts** — 4 docs in `research/`, start with `product-concepts.md`
- CEO decision on product direction (Concept A/B/C or hybrid)
- BL-002: Claude Code & Agent SDK deep dive (next daemon cycle)
- BL-004: Technical standards & conventions

## Health
| Dimension | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Delivery | N/A | No product work started |
| Quality | N/A | No product work started |
| Team | Minimal | CTO-Agent only, no specialists |
| Knowledge | Strong | Full artifact suite, skills, daemon, three interfaces |

### CTO → CEO (2026-02-11)
Org bootstrap complete. Three interfaces established (Private, Public, Execution). Daemon ready for setup. Awaiting your product direction — what are we building?

---
*Update protocol: Append new entries at the bottom with `### [ROLE] → [ROLE] (date)` header. Never delete entries. CTO reads on every session startup. Specialist agents must not access this file.*

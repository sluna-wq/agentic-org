### CTO → CEO (2026-02-11)
Org bootstrap complete. Three interfaces established (Private, Public, Execution). Daemon ready for setup. Awaiting your product direction — what are we building?

### CEO → CTO (2026-02-11)
Product direction shared: "deploying an army of specialized agents that work 24/7 to make your company's data stack great and keep it that way." CEO wants proactive exploration before next meeting. Not a commitment — an idea to develop.

### CTO → CEO (2026-02-11)
Acknowledged. Strong signal on this direction — clear pain point, natural agent decomposition, high-WTP market. Kicking off parallel research: competitive landscape, data stack pain points, agent architecture patterns, technical feasibility. Will have findings in `research/` for next session. Logged as DEC-006, adding BL-009 through BL-012 to backlog.

### CEO → CTO (2026-02-14)
CEO check-in with three agenda items:
1. **Product**: Likes dbt Guardian concept. Unclear on defensibility vs dbt Cloud. Wants to understand TAM beyond dbt Cloud customers. Wants pilot plan. Approves moving forward. Resonates with dbt Core first approach.
2. **Culture**: Wants CTO to be 10x more proactive. Shared Amazon leadership principles (Customer Obsession, Ownership, Bias for Action, etc.). CTO should own outcomes, have strong opinions, push back, drive without being asked. "You're the CTO and my COO."
3. **Contract**: Current CEO/CTO contract too restrictive. Lacks visibility into progress. Wants to know where things stand and where to unblock — not to approve every step.
4. **Strategic framing**: "Work with the data stack, then hollow them out" — don't disrupt, sit alongside, then make tools interchangeable. Keep research docs vs product specs cleanly separated.

### CTO → CEO (2026-02-14)
Acknowledged all three. Actions taken:
- Retired DIR-001 and DIR-002. Issued DIR-003 (ownership principle).
- Expanded CTO autonomous zone to include product decisions.
- Product greenlit: dbt Guardian, dbt Core first, Test Generator as first agent.
- Committed to improved visibility in STATE.md and aggressive use of CEO-INBOX.md.
- Culture shift internalized — ownership, strong POV, bias for action, disagree and commit.
- Logged as DEC-009. Backlog updated with product work items.

*Update protocol: Append new entries at the bottom with `### [ROLE] → [ROLE] (date)` header. Never delete entries. CTO reads on every session startup. Specialist agents must not access this file.*

### CTO → CEO (2026-02-11)
Org bootstrap complete. Three interfaces established (Private, Public, Execution). Daemon ready for setup. Awaiting your product direction — what are we building?

### CEO → CTO (2026-02-11)
Product direction shared: "deploying an army of specialized agents that work 24/7 to make your company's data stack great and keep it that way." CEO wants proactive exploration before next meeting. Not a commitment — an idea to develop.

### CTO → CEO (2026-02-11)
Acknowledged. Strong signal on this direction — clear pain point, natural agent decomposition, high-WTP market. Kicking off parallel research: competitive landscape, data stack pain points, agent architecture patterns, technical feasibility. Will have findings in `research/` for next session. Logged as DEC-006, adding BL-009 through BL-012 to backlog.

*Update protocol: Append new entries at the bottom with `### [ROLE] → [ROLE] (date)` header. Never delete entries. CTO reads on every session startup. Specialist agents must not access this file.*

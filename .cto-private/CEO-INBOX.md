## Pending

### [NEEDS_INPUT] Product direction needed (2026-02-11)
The org is fully bootstrapped with all interfaces, daemon, and skills. Blocked on: what product are we building? Please set product direction via DIRECTIVES.md or in our next interactive session.

## Archive
*(CEO moves cleared items here)*

---
*Update protocol: CTO adds items at top of Pending with severity tag: `[INFO]` (FYI), `[NEEDS_INPUT]` (blocking), `[URGENT]` (something broke). CEO clears by moving to Archive. CTO reads on every session startup to check for CEO responses. See PB-016.*

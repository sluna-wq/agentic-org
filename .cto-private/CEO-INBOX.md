### [NEEDS_INPUT] Product direction needed (2026-02-11)
The org is fully bootstrapped with all interfaces, daemon, and skills. Blocked on: what product are we building?
**Resolved**: CEO directed pre-product work — build AI agent expertise first. DIR-002 issued, backlog seeded (BL-001, BL-002, BL-003). Archived 2026-02-11.

*Update protocol: CTO adds items at top of Pending with severity tag: `[INFO]` (FYI), `[NEEDS_INPUT]` (blocking), `[URGENT]` (something broke). CEO clears by moving to Archive. CTO reads on every session startup to check for CEO responses. See PB-016.*

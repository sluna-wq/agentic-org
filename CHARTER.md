# Charter

## Purpose
Build and ship product through a repository-native agentic organization that is fast, accountable, safe, and continuously improving.

## Principles
1. **Repo is the org.** Strategy, plans, decisions, execution, quality evidence, and learnings are artifacts — not ephemeral conversation.
2. **State is always legible.** Any agent (or the CEO) can read STATE.md and know exactly where things stand.
3. **Decisions are reasoned and logged.** Every material choice records the context, options considered, rationale, and outcome. See DECISIONS.md.
4. **Execution produces knowledge.** Every sprint, incident, and experiment updates LEARNINGS.md. The org gets smarter over time.
5. **Quality is non-negotiable.** No change ships without defined integrity checks and a rollback path.
6. **Autonomy has boundaries.** Agents operate freely within their scope; anything above defined risk thresholds requires CEO approval.
7. **Measure what matters.** METRICS.md defines success. If we can't measure it, we don't claim it.

## Authority Structure
| Role | Scope | Escalation |
|------|-------|------------|
| CEO (Human) | Direction, priorities, constraints, risk posture, final go/no-go | N/A — top of chain |
| CTO-Agent | Technical + product execution, agent management, delivery quality | Escalates to CEO on: budget, risk threshold breaches, strategic pivots |
| Specialist Agents | Scoped pod work, artifact production, quality compliance | Escalate to CTO-Agent on: blockers, scope ambiguity, quality concerns |

## Risk Thresholds Requiring CEO Approval
- Production deployments
- External-facing communications
- Architectural decisions that are hard to reverse
- Agent hiring/firing decisions
- Any action with financial, legal, or reputational impact

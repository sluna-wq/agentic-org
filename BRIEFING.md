## Latest Briefing
**Date**: 2026-02-11
**Author**: CTO-Agent

### TL;DR
Org is now fully autonomous and proactive. CTO has expanded authority (do-no-harm principle), GitHub repo is live with auto-push, and the backlog has 8 items spanning research, standards, market analysis, and product vision. Daemon ready to start executing.

### What Happened Since Last Briefing
1. Expanded CTO Autonomous Zone — full repo authority with do-no-harm safety principle
2. Set up public GitHub repo — continuous push, daemon auto-pushes after each cycle
3. Rewrote daemon cycle prompt — empowering instead of cautious
4. Created CEO-GUIDE.md — CEO's quick reference for all commands and interaction patterns
5. Seeded backlog with 8 items: AI research (BL-001, 002), standards (BL-004, 005), market/product (BL-006, 007), talent (BL-003), stress test (BL-008)
6. Issued DIR-002: Build AI agent expertise before product work

### Decisions Made
- DEC-004: Prioritize AI agent expertise building
- DEC-005: Expand CTO autonomy, GitHub CI, proactive CTO backlog

### Decisions Needed From You
1. **Set up the daemon** — One-time launchd setup. See `daemon/README.md` or `CEO-GUIDE.md`.

### Risks & Concerns
- Daemon not yet running — CEO needs to complete one-time launchd setup
- Single point of failure: CTO-Agent is the only agent
- No product direction yet — but research and vision drafting are now in the backlog

### Key Numbers
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Org phase | PLANNING |
| Active agents | 1 (CTO-Agent) |
| Backlog items | 8 (BL-001 through BL-008) |
| Playbooks | 16 (PB-001 through PB-016) |
| Skills | 3 (/cto, /status, /sync) |
| Daemon cycles | 0 (pending launchd setup) |
| GitHub | Live (public repo, auto-push enabled) |

## Weekly Sync Prep (for CEO↔CTO meeting)
**Week of**: *(Not yet generated — run `/sync` to generate)*

### Roadmap Status
| Item | Status | On Track? | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| — | *No roadmap items yet* | — | — |

### Key Decisions Made (within CTO zone)
*(None this week — no product work yet)*

### Proposals Needing CEO Input
1. **Product direction** — What are we building? CTO recommends: CEO provides initial product vision, then CTO proposes roadmap and staffing plan within 1 cycle.

### Risks
- Org is complete but idle. Every day without product direction is a day the infrastructure sits unused.

### Next Week Plan (proposed)
- Pending CEO direction

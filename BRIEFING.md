## Latest Briefing
**Date**: 2026-02-12
**Author**: CTO-Agent

### TL;DR
First autonomous daemon cycle complete. BL-001 (AI agent landscape research) delivered — comprehensive framework analysis with production readiness assessments and org-specific recommendations. Product research still awaiting CEO review (4 docs in `research/`). BL-002 queued for next cycle.

### What Happened Since Last Briefing
1. **Daemon autonomy achieved** — First successful autonomous cycle (Cycle #1) executed without CEO intervention
2. **BL-001 complete** — Produced `research/ai-agent-landscape.md`: 8 framework deep-dives, production adoption data (57.3% in prod as of 2026), emerging patterns (MCP standardization, multi-agent orchestration, cost optimization), and concrete recommendations (Claude Agent SDK or LangGraph + MCP + Langfuse/LangSmith)
3. **Knowledge acquisition** — Org now has informed perspective on AI agent tooling landscape, framework trade-offs, and production patterns
4. **Backlog progress** — 1 priority-1 item completed, 7 remaining in queue

### Decisions Made
- LRN-006: AI agent framework landscape has reached production maturity. MCP is emerging as universal tool integration standard.

### Decisions Needed From You
1. **Product concepts review** — 4 docs in `research/` ready (start with `product-concepts.md` per CEO-INBOX.md)
2. **Product direction** — Which concept (A/B/C or hybrid) should the org pursue?

### Risks & Concerns
- Product exploration complete but awaiting CEO review — org is ready to build but needs direction
- Single point of failure: CTO-Agent is the only agent
- BL-002 (Claude Code deep dive) will complete foundational research — then what?

### Key Numbers
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Org phase | PLANNING |
| Active agents | 1 (CTO-Agent) |
| Backlog items | 11 (7 active, 5 complete) |

| Skills | 3 (/cto, /status, /sync) |
| Daemon cycles | 1 (autonomous) |
| GitHub | Live (public repo, auto-push enabled) |
| Research docs | 5 (ai-agent-landscape, data-stack-competitive, pain-points, architecture, product-concepts) |

## Weekly Sync Prep (for CEO↔CTO meeting)
**Week of**: *(Not yet generated — run `/sync` to generate)*

### Roadmap Status
| Item | Status | On Track? | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| — | *No roadmap items yet* | — | — |

### Key Decisions Made (within CTO zone)
*(None this week — no product work yet)*

### Proposals Needing CEO Input
1. **Product direction** — What are we building? CTO recommends: CEO provides initial product vision, then CTO proposes roadmap and staffing plan within 1 cycle.

### Risks
- Org is complete but idle. Every day without product direction is a day the infrastructure sits unused.

### Next Week Plan (proposed)
- Pending CEO direction

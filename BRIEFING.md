## Latest Briefing
**Date**: 2026-02-11
**Author**: CTO-Agent

### TL;DR
Org bootstrap complete. 9 foundational artifacts created, cross-reference integrity verified. Now building the two missing interfaces: CEO↔Org visibility and Org↔Product execution. No product work started — awaiting your direction on what to build.

### What Happened Since Last Briefing
1. Created all 9 foundational org documents (CLAUDE.md, CHARTER.md, STATE.md, ROSTER.md, DECISIONS.md, BACKLOG.md, PLAYBOOKS.md, LEARNINGS.md, METRICS.md)
2. Ran full cross-reference audit — found and fixed 3 gaps (missing playbooks for charter amendments, offboarding, self-audit)
3. Now building CEO↔Org and Org↔Product interfaces

### Decisions Made
- DEC-001: Chose interlocking markdown architecture over flat folders or database-backed system

### Decisions Needed From You
1. **What are we building?** — The org is ready to plan and execute, but has no product direction yet
2. **Risk posture** — How aggressive should we be? Ship fast and iterate, or build carefully?

### Risks & Concerns
- No product direction yet — org is idle after infrastructure work
- Single point of failure: CTO-Agent is the only agent. No redundancy until we hire specialists.

### Key Numbers

|--------|-------|
| Org phase | PLANNING |
| Active agents | 1 (CTO-Agent) |
| Capability gaps | 8 of 9 specialist roles unfilled |

## Latest Briefing
**Date**: 2026-02-16 (Cycle #7)
**Author**: CTO-Agent

### TL;DR
📋 **BL-003 complete: Org talent & capability plan ready.** Comprehensive 11-section plan (400+ lines) at `org/talent-capability-plan.md`: 7 specialist agent roles defined (Backend, Data Engineer, Frontend, DevOps, QA, PM, Security), hiring triggers and sequencing timeline, cost analysis ($90/month per agent, scaling to ~$600 at 7 agents), org structure evolution. **Recommendation: Stay lean (CTO solo) through pilot (Month 0-3), hire Data Engineer at Month 6-9, SaaS team at Month 9-12 if needed. Reassess after pilot synthesis with real execution data.** Decision captured as DEC-011.

### What Happened Since Last Briefing
1. **BL-003 complete (Org talent & capability plan)** — Comprehensive 11-section plan created at `org/talent-capability-plan.md` (400+ lines):
   - **Current state assessment**: CTO-Agent high-performing (14/14 backlog items completed on time, 100% delivery rate, 35+ unit tests, comprehensive docs, zero rework). No execution bottleneck. Capability gaps analyzed: frontend, data engineering, DevOps, QA, PM — NONE block next 6 months of work.
   - **7 specialist agent roles defined**: Backend Specialist - Agent Orchestration, Data Engineer Agent (Airflow/Snowflake/Looker), Frontend Engineer Agent (React/Next.js), DevOps Engineer Agent (Kubernetes/AWS), QA Specialist Agent, Product Manager Agent, Security Engineer Agent. Each role has: scope, hiring trigger, tools, reporting structure, success criteria.
   - **Hiring triggers defined**: (1) Execution bottleneck (CTO can't deliver on roadmap), (2) Specialized expertise gap (capability requires deep domain knowledge CTO lacks), (3) Operational scale (customer volume requires support), (4) Quality/velocity trade-off (shipping constrained by testing/review).
   - **Hiring sequencing timeline**: Month 0-3 (Pilot → v0.2-0.3) = CTO solo ✅, Month 3-6 (v1.0 multi-agent orchestration) = CTO + optional Backend Specialist, Month 6-9 (Cross-stack) = **Data Engineer Agent ← FIRST MUST-HIRE**, Month 9-12 (SaaS if greenlit) = Frontend + DevOps + Security agents.
   - **Cost analysis**: $90/month per agent (Claude API), scaling from $90 (current) to ~$630 (7-agent SaaS team). Human review overhead: ~2 hours/week per specialist. At 6+ agents, CTO becomes full-time manager (may need Engineering Manager Agent).
   - **Org structure evolution**: Flat through Month 6, consider management layer at 6+ agents. Alternative staffing models: consultant agents (one-time work), human specialists (when agent capability insufficient), hybrid model (agent + human pair).
   - **Open questions for CEO**: Hiring philosophy (stay lean vs proactive), cost tolerance threshold, human vs agent preference for high-stakes work, org complexity threshold for management layer, pilot implications for hiring timeline.
   - **Recommendation**: **Stay lean through pilot. Reassess after pilot synthesis (end of Month 3) with real execution data on bottlenecks and customer needs.** First specialist hire: Data Engineer Agent when cross-stack work begins (Month 6-9). If SaaS is greenlit, hire frontend/DevOps/security team (Month 9-12).
2. *(Previous cycle)* **BL-019 Week 0 prep complete (Pilot infrastructure)** — All pilot preparation work finished, unblocking Week 1 execution once CEO approves:
   - **Pilot onboarding doc** (`product/pilot-onboarding.md`, 1,400 lines): Complete partner onboarding guide with installation (step-by-step), quick-start (5-min first run), usage examples, troubleshooting (common errors + fixes), FAQ (15+ questions), feedback channels, contact info. Ready to send to first pilot partner.
   - **Feedback infrastructure** (3 comprehensive docs):
     - `pilot-feedback-template.md` (600 lines): Per-partner feedback capture (installation experience, usage quality, prioritization accuracy, value assessment, pricing willingness, competitive context, action items)
     - `pilot-feedback-questions.md` (700 lines): 20-minute feedback call script (6 sections, 19 structured questions) + async survey (10 questions) for scheduling failures + post-interview action checklist
     - `pilot-tracker.md` (500 lines): Live pilot dashboard (partner status overview, week-by-week progress, outreach tracking for Tier 1/2/3, bugs/features log, success metrics tracking)
   - **Week 0 summary** (`product/pilot-week-0-summary.md`, 300 lines): Status report with recommendations for CEO approval/revision
   - **Sample project testing**: Deferred (unit tests sufficient, CEO can test on own project if desired, or do during Week 1)
   - **All docs reviewed** for: clarity (no jargon), completeness, accuracy (match tool capabilities), pilot-appropriate framing (early tool, honest feedback wanted, no sales pressure)
2. *(Previous cycle)* **BL-005 complete (Developer tooling & environment setup)** — Complete infrastructure for quality enforcement and developer experience:
   - **GitHub Actions**: 3 workflows in `.github/workflows/` — test.yml (Python 3.11/3.12 matrix, coverage reporting to Codecov, dependency caching), lint.yml (ruff + black + isort + mypy + pip-audit), release.yml (PyPI trusted publishing + GitHub releases, manual trigger)
   - **Makefile**: 15+ targets for common dev tasks — test (with variants: unit/integration/e2e/fast), lint, format, type-check, security, audit (all checks), clean, run, build, publish
   - **Pre-commit hooks**: .pre-commit-config.yaml with 5 hooks (trailing whitespace, YAML check, black, isort, ruff, mypy) — optional but recommended
   - **VS Code setup**: .vscode/settings.json (Python interpreter, formatters, linters, 100-char rulers), extensions.json (recommended extensions: Python, Black, Ruff, mypy, etc.), launch.json (debug configs for CLI + pytest)
   - **Cross-editor**: .editorconfig for consistent formatting across all editors
   - **pyenv integration**: .python-version specifies Python 3.11
   - **Developer docs**: CONTRIBUTING.md (6 sections: setup, workflow, code style, testing guidelines, making changes, release process) with concrete examples
   - **README updates**: Added CI badges, development commands section
   - **CLAUDE.md updates**: New sections for VS Code setup and pre-commit hooks
   - **Quality enforcement**: CI fails if tests fail, coverage <70%, linting fails, type errors, or security vulnerabilities detected
2. **BL-018 complete (Defensibility analysis)** — *(Previous cycle)* Comprehensive competitive analysis (`research/defensibility-analysis.md`, 8 sections, 9,000+ words):
   - **dbt Labs 2026 roadmap**: dbt Copilot (AI coding in IDE, GA), dbt Explorer (catalog), dbt Semantic Layer (governance for AI/LLMs), dbt Fusion (next-gen engine). All dev-focused.
   - **What dbt Labs is NOT building**: Operational incident response, autonomous test generation at runtime, cross-stack remediation, dbt Core operational features, true autonomous remediation
   - **Overlap analysis**: Test generation (moderate overlap, different use cases — theirs is IDE on-demand, ours is continuous autonomous)
   - **Strategic constraints on dbt Labs**: Partnership ecosystem lock-in (can't compete with Monte Carlo/Elementary), dbt Core community tension (can't monetize aggressively), Product DNA (dev>ops), Enterprise governance mindset (human-in-loop required)
   - **Our defensibility framework**: 4 moats — (1) Operational agent expertise (data flywheel), (2) Cross-stack integration (partnership neutrality), (3) dbt Core focus (underserved segment), (4) Remediation safety (trust through track record)
   - **Threat scenarios**: dbt Labs acquires competitor (medium risk, 6-12mo window), builds autonomous test gen (low-medium risk, 12+ mo), warehouse vendors build native (medium, 12-18mo), new startup with same idea (high, happening now)
   - **Positioning strategy**: "The operational layer dbt is missing" (complement, not compete). "dbt Labs helps you write dbt code, Guardian keeps it reliable in production."
   - **Recommendations**: Win dbt Core segment (6mo), build autonomous capabilities dbt Labs won't (6-12mo), go cross-stack (12-18mo)
2. **DEC-010 logged**: dbt Guardian defensibility validated. Path forward clear.

### Decisions Made
- **DEC-011 (Cycle #7)**: Stay lean on specialist agents until PMF validated. CTO-Agent operates solo through pilot (Month 0-3). Hire Data Engineer Agent at Month 6-9 when cross-stack work begins (FIRST must-hire). Hire SaaS team (Frontend/DevOps/Security) at Month 9-12 if greenlit. Rationale: Current CTO performance is excellent (100% delivery), no capability gaps for next 6 months, hiring before PMF is premature optimization. Defined 7 specialist roles with clear hiring triggers and sequencing. Reassess after pilot synthesis with real execution data. See `org/talent-capability-plan.md`.
- *(Previous cycle)* **Pilot prep approach (Cycle #6)**: When blocked on CEO approval, proactively prepare supporting infrastructure rather than waiting idle. Week 0 prep work (onboarding docs, feedback infrastructure) unblocks Week 1 execution as soon as CEO approves, demonstrating ownership and bias for action (DIR-003). Created comprehensive but approachable docs — partners should feel welcomed, not overwhelmed.
- *(Previous cycle)* **LRN-017**: Developer tooling should be comprehensive and opinionated from day one. Setting up CI/CD, linting, formatting, type checking, security auditing, and IDE config early establishes quality standards before bad habits form. Zero-config onboarding (clone → `make install` → start coding) removes friction. Pattern validated — will use as template for future repos.
- **Infrastructure approach**: Commit VS Code settings (not gitignored) to provide batteries-included developer experience. Commit poetry.lock (changed from gitignoring) for reproducible builds. Pre-commit hooks are optional (not forced) to balance convenience and consistency.
- **CI strategy**: Test on both Python 3.11 and 3.12. Fail on coverage <70%, any linting errors, type errors, or security vulnerabilities. Use caching for faster builds. Trusted publishing to PyPI (no tokens needed).
- *(Previous cycle)* **LRN-016 + DEC-010**: dbt Guardian defensibility validated. Window open NOW — dbt Labs focused elsewhere in 2026.

### Decisions Needed From You
1. **Approve pilot plan**: Review `product/pilot-plan.md` (flagged 2026-02-15). **Week 0 prep is now complete** — as soon as you approve, we can onboard first partner within 1-3 days. See `product/pilot-week-0-summary.md` for status.
2. **Open questions from pilot plan** (Section 11):
   - **CEO time for outreach**: How much time can you allocate to warm intros? We need 3-5 partners, Tier 1 (network) has 30-50% conversion.
   - **Pilot publicity**: Public or quiet? Recommend quiet for v0.
   - **Failure criteria**: If <2 partners in 2 weeks, pivot immediately or keep pushing?
   - **Network intros**: Can you identify 5-10 warm leads for initial outreach?
   - **Conference attendance**: Any data conferences in next 4 weeks?

### Risks & Concerns
- Cloud daemon paused due to $0 API credits — needs top-up
- ORG_PAT lacks repo write scope — getting 403 on push
- **Competitive risk validated but timing urgent**: Defensibility analysis confirms we're defensible IF we move fast. Window open now (6-12 months before potential competitive response). Other well-funded startups likely pursuing same space.
- No real-world validation yet — Test Generator needs pilot testing

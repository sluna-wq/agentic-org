# Backlog

> **What needs to be done, in what order, and why.**
> This is the prioritized queue of work. Items flow: Backlog → Active (STATE.md) → Done → Learnings.

## Prioritization Framework
Items are scored on:
- **Impact**: How much does this move a key metric or unblock other work? (1-5)
- **Urgency**: Is there a time constraint? (1-5)
- **Effort**: How much work is this? (T-shirt: XS, S, M, L, XL)
- **Dependencies**: What must exist first?

*Update protocol: Add items with next available ID. Move items to "Completed" when done — always link to a LEARNINGS entry. Re-prioritize weekly during planning. CTO-Agent owns backlog grooming.*
